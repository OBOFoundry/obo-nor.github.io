      description: Model card reports are documents detailing transparent metadata information relating to machine learning models. Similar to what we have with drug labels and nutritional labels, the goal of model cards are to communicate relevant information on all aspects of a machine learning model that have undergone any experimentation. However these important reports of the machine learning models are presented in static documents. This work encodes the structure of model card reports and align them to standard OBO Foundry ontologies to help formalize and enrich these documents. The end result is computable model of the model card that can be used to standardize reporting and be integrated in future software tooling (searching and indexing, etc.).

      description: CDMO is a Chinese diabetes ontology, classes cover all aspects of diabetes, such as symptoms, medications, tests, body structure, social background, etc. Most of these classes have been mapped to existing classes in the OBO, and these mappings are represented by annotation properties. Our motivation is to apply this ontology to the construction of Chinese diabetes knowledge graph, natural language processing and medical question answering, which are all application scenarios closely related to language. We hope that this ontology can be adopted by researchers and developers of the above application systems.
